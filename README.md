# Endangered_Language_Risk_Analysis

Personal Projec: Explored different machine learning models to determine the algorithm that best predicts endangered language risk. 

To approach this unbalanced classfication problem, I trained and evaluated models with unbalanced classes.

I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 

I then compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict endangered language risk. 

Lastly, I evaluated the performance of these models to make an effective comparison and recommendation towards the best model. 

This is an excellent use of machine learning that can be applied in sociological and linguistic research.
